                I am a UX Designer with a background in Visual Arts and Communications. I am both creative and
                analytical. I graduated from the University of Georgia with a Bachelor of Arts degree in History, a
                Studio Art Minor, and a Museum Studies Certificate in December of 2019. From my degree, I gained
                research, writing, and presentation skills. I specialized in public history with an emphasis on
                diversity and technology. While in school, I led a large student organization for two years as
                president. As a communications intern, I wrote press releases and edited other marketing materials in
                the communications department at the Georgia Museum of Art. My training as a historian makes me an
                excellent researcher, writer, and presenter. I graduated from the Georgia Tech UX/UI boot camp in
                September of 2020. I worked alongside a team to design two original mobile applications and a responsive
                web design website. Some transferable skills to UX from previous roles include time management, editing,
                and collaboration.
